# Learning Search Engine

This repo is created to facilitate learning and experimentation with search engine algorithms, techniques, and technologies.

## Features & Areas of Study

The repository will focus on, but not be limited to, the following:

1. **Crawling**:
   - Understand how search engines collect and update web content.
   - Knowledge of Spider Traps.
   - Understand robots.txt & sitemap.xml. 
   - Develop basic web crawlers to gather data from websites.

2. **Natural Language Processing - NLP**: Learn Text Pre-processing techniques
   - Tokenization
   - Lemmatization
   - Stop Words Removal
   - Stemming
   
2. **Indexing**:
   - Learn how to structure and organize large amounts of data for efficient retrieval.
   - Implement inverted indexes and study different indexing techniques.

3. **Ranking & Relevance**:
   - Understand and implement Web Graph.
   - Understand how factors like PageRank or user interaction data can affect search results (PageRank with Damping Factor).
   - Implement ranking algorithms like TF-IDF, PageRank and explore how search engines rank pages based on relevance.

5. **Information Retrieval**:
   - Understand Vector Space Model and Cosine Similarity.
   - Implement Vector Space Retrieval.
  
6. **Deep Learning**: Using CNNs (VGG16) to Build Reverse Image Search Engine
   - Understand Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
   - Using VGG16 - a CNN Model to build Reverse Image Search Engine.
